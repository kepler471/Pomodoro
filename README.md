# Pomodoro
A simple productivity timer for Windows. Inspired by the gnome-pomodoro shell extension

The app will run as a tray icon application, and will create a full screen overlay when the user should take a break.

This overlay will be easily bypassed by simply clicking if the user needs to use their computer.

Aiming for cross-platform but is currently tested for Windows only.
